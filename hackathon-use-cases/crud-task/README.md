# Use-Cases

The hackathon consists of four use-cases. These use-cases focus on the FHIR `Task` resource. This Resource is the core of Koppeltaal and references other important Resources. At the end of the hackathon, we would like to see the following use-cases working:

1. Assign a `Task` to a `Patient` as a `Practitioner`.
2. Launch a `Task` from a patient portal using [HTI](../../technische-howto/launchen/).
3. Launch a `Task` from a patient portal using [SMART HTI On FHIR](broken-reference).
4. Subscribe to changes
