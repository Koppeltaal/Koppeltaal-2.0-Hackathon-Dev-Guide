# Proof Of Concept

Koppeltaal 2.0 has been developed by using an Agile methodology. The devised architecture is tested using POC applications. The applications used within the POC are **not** the applications that will ultimately be used when Koppeltaal 2.0 goes live.

{% hint style="info" %}
Applications within the POC now often use IRMA to identify the user and relate across systems. This is not part of the standard. It's likely that Koppeltaal 2.0 will not use IRMA in the production environment.
{% endhint %}

The POC consists of the following type of applications:

| Applicatietype     | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| System component   | Applications that form the core of Koppeltaal 2.0.                                             |
| Supplier           | A supplier who uses their non-production platform together with the PoC Koppeltaal 2.0 Server. |
| Pseudo-application | Application that mimics an e-health application.                                               |
| Additional service | Application that is not part of the Koppeltaal standard, but helps during the development.     |

The POC consists of the following applications:

| Application              | Type               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Koppeltaal Server        | System component   | A FHIR HAPI R4 implementation for Koppeltaal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Domain Management        | System component   | Applications can register to join a domain. A role is also assigned to applications, which determines what actions the application is allowed to perform on the Koppeltaal Server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Auth Server              | System component   | Here - after approval from Domain Management - applications can request an access token via the [Backend Services Authorization](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/authorization/index.html#obtaining-an-access-token) flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Koppeltaal IdP           | System component   | Identity Provider (IdP) used to validate that the launching user matches the logged in user. This essentially prevents tokens from being intercepted and executed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Minddistrict             | Supplier           | Within this POC it functions as a "real" eHealth Module. This allows us to test concepts and implementations again a real system. This helps to test the concepts and ease of integration with an existing system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| EHR                      | Pseudo-application | This application is made to imitate an EHR. Ultimately, this has grown into an application where the common Koppeltaal Resources can be managed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Portal                   | Pseudo-application | <p>This application functions as a patient portal, practitioner portal and related person portal. When one logs in here (via the IdP, not with IRMA), the portal searches for a user by the logged-in e-mail address in the Koppeltaal Server. The role is determined depending on which resource is found (<code>Patient</code>, <code>Practitioner</code> or <code>RelatedPerson</code>).<br></p><p>Anyone can create an account at the POC IdP. It is important that the IdP username is also set as an identifier in the user resource (system is ignored, so only the value has to match).</p> |
| Domain Access Test Suite | Additional service | <p>Geen officieel component, maar erg handig tijdens de ontwikkeling. Deze test suite helpt bij de implementatie van de  <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/authorization/index.html#obtaining-an-access-token">Backend Services Authorization</a>.<br><br>This test suite helps with the implementation of the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/authorization/index.html#obtaining-an-access-token">Backend Services Authorization</a>.</p>                                                                                                                                        |
| Launch Test Suite        | Additional service | Can be used to test the [HTI](../../technische-howto/launchen/hti.md) & [SHOF](../../technische-howto/launchen/smart-hti-on-fhir.md) launch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
