# Koppeltaal Test Tooling

The [Koppeltaal Test Tooling](https://testsuite.koppeltaal.headease.nl/) can be seen as an interactive dev-guide. It offers a rich set of tools that help developers implement Koppeltaal. It can visualize many of the technical how-to items from this developer guide.

It can be used to test the common Koppeltaal interactions like: [Connecting to Koppeltaal](connectie-maken-met-koppeltaal/), [Launching](launchen/), [CRUD operations](resources-managen/crud-operaties/) and [Subscribing to changes](resources-managen/abonneren-op-changes.md).&#x20;

## What Koppeltaal server does it use?

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is not allowed to use the Koppeltaal Test Tooling on Itzos acc22 and production. Requests here should not be allowed.
{% endhint %}

The Test Tooling is a multitenant solution that allows you to work against multiple Koppeltaal servers (like the POC and Itzos acc21). You can configure your own clients.

## How to get started?

Navigate to the [Koppeltaal Test Tooling](https://testsuite.koppeltaal.headease.nl) and try it out. Everyone can register. It also allows you to work together with your colleagues by sharing SMART clients. Follow this video on how to set up your first Koppeltaal client:
